    Scaled Dot-Product Attention proposed in "Attention Is All You Need"
    Compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by sqrt(dim),
    and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values
    Args: dim, mask
        dim (int): dimention of attention
        mask (torch.Tensor): tensor containing indices to be masked
    Inputs: query, key, value, mask
        - **query** (batch, q_len, d_model): tensor containing projection vector for decoder.
        - **key** (batch, k_len, d_model): tensor containing projection vector for encoder.
        - **value** (batch, v_len, d_model): tensor containing features of the encoded input sequence.
        - **mask** (-): tensor containing indices to be masked
    Returns: context, attn
        - **context**: tensor containing the context vector from attention mechanism.
        - **attn**: tensor containing the attention (alignment) from the encoder outputs.
